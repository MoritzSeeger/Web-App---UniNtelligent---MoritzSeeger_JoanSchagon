The depicted ERD describes the core data model of 6 entities which are required for the core function of our project. 
All of the entities shown have been created as classes in python and have been fitted with parameters/constrants. For further detail please check models.py. In db.py the SQLite database was created and the corresponding database can be found under /instances/app.db
